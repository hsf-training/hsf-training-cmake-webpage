* [Modern CMake][]: The book this tutorial derives from.
* [The official help](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/): Really amazing documentation. Nicely organized, great search, and you can toggle versions at the top. It just doesn't have a great "best practices tutorial", which is what this book tries to fill in.
* [Effective Modern CMake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1): A great list of do's and don'ts.
* [Embracing Modern CMake](https://steveire.wordpress.com/2017/11/05/embracing-modern-cmake/): A post with good description of the term
* [It's time to do CMake Right](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/): A nice set of best practices for Modern CMake projects.
* [The Ultimate Guide to Modern CMake](https://rix0r.nl/blog/2015/08/13/cmake-guide/): A slightly dated post with similar intent.
* [More Modern CMake](https://youtu.be/y7ndUhdQuU8): A great presentation from Meeting C++ 2018 that recommends CMake 3.12+. This talk makes calls CMake 3.0+ "Modern CMake" and CMake 3.12+ "More Modern CMake".
* [toeb/moderncmake](https://github.com/toeb/moderncmake): A nice presentation and examples about CMake 3.5+, with intro to syntax through project organization
