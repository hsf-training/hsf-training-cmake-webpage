Welcome to HSF CMake tutorial! The aim of this tutorial is to cover the basics of using CMake. This
tutorial is based on the online book [Modern CMake][], with a focus on CMake 3.15+. This is in what
is [called the "More Modern" era](https://github.com/Bagira80/More-Modern-CMake) of CMake (roughly
defined as 3.12+), and includes the fantastic command line improvements in CMake Ï€ (3.14) and 3.15.
The current version at the time of writing is CMake 3.21.

This workshop covers the basics of making and building a project, and some details of design.
