# Writing a CMakeLists

The following file is fine for the following examples:

{% include hl_code.html file="code/00-intro/simple.c" lang="c" %}

This file can be compiled with C or C++.

## Starting off

This is the simplest possible `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(MyProject)

add_executable(myexample simple.cpp)
```

Let's look at the three lines:

1. The [`cmake_minimum_required`][] command sets the policies so that the build is exactly like it
   would be on the listed version of CMake - in other words, CMake "dumbs itself down" to the
   version you request for any features that could produce a different build. This makes CMake
   almost perfectly backwards compatible.
2. You need to be working on a [`project`], and it needs at least a name. CMake assumes a `CXX`
   (that's C++) and `C` mixed project if you don't give any [`LANGUAGES`][`project`].
3. You need at least one library or executable to do anything interesting. The "thing" you make here
   is called a "target", and the executable/library has the same name, by default, and it has to be
   unique in the project. You use [`add_executable`][] for programs, and [`add_library`][] for
   libraries.

Those commands have a few extra arguments that you can give:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14...3.18)

project(MyProject
  VERSION
    1.0
  DESCRIPTION
    "Very nice project"
  LANGUAGES
    CXX
)

add_executable(myexample simple.cpp)
```

1. You can specify a range of versions - this will cause the policies to be set to
   the highest supported value in that range. As a general rule, set the highest version you've
   tested with here.
2. Projects can have versions, descriptions, and languages.
3. Whitespace doesn't matter. Be clear/pretty, or use
   [cmake-format](https://cmake-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
