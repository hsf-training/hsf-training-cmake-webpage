keypoints:
- ROOT has a CONFIG package you can use to integrate with CMake.

Let's try a couple of ROOT examples; one with the classic variable/global configure and one with the
newer target method. You will need a ROOT install or a ROOT docker container to run these examples.
You can use `rootproject/root:latest` to test this, which is an official
Ubuntu based build. Conda-Forge ROOT + CMake would work too, if you like Conda. (ROOT has tags for
lots of other base images, too).

For these examples, you should be using a recent version of ROOT - especially for targets, which is
still being worked on. The CONFIG files were added in 6.10, and targets received a lot of work in
6.14+. 6.16 has pretty decent targets.

## Example 1: UseROOT

Change to the `code/05a-root` directory.  Run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cd build
cmake --build .
root -b -q -x ../CheckLoad.C
```

{% include hl_code.html lang="cmake" file="code/05a-root/CMakeLists.txt" %}



## Example 2: Targets

Change to the `code/05b-root` directory. Run the same command above.

{% include hl_code.html lang="cmake" file="code/05b-root/CMakeLists.txt" %}

{% include links.md %}
